* Initial development tasks
** TODO Get documentation with sphinx set up
** TODO Get virtualenv set up
Will probably use the following packages:
- Scipy to help with curve fitting and chi square optimization
- 

** TODO Establish API for the following:
- [ ] Curve fitting function - take data in and generate a four-param fit
- [ ] Given four-param values, start, stop, and step size, generate values
** TODO Tests for the curve fit
Probably the hardest part, because there are multiple test cases
- [ ] Exact fit
- [ ] Bad fit
- [ ] Good fit
These all need to be done manually
** TODO Test for the functions value
** TODO Design a PyQt interface which uses the different bits:
- [ ] Not sure how to load data into the app
- [ ] Load data, fit a best fit, plot and note it all
- [ ] Plot it
